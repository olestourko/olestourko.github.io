## About Me

I am a software developer, mostly using Python and PHP.
My current job is full-stack web developer at [Digital Extremes](http://www.digitalextremes.com/) in London, Ontario.
My background is in Computer Science and I've been doing web development professionally for the past 4 years. Backend and full-stack roles are my favourite when it comes to web.

I'm also a machine learning hobbyist and am very interested in how we can use it to solve problems. Investing and sustainability are areas I like, and my personal projects are _usually_ related to them.
